### 3.2.1 1x (INPUT)

Status codes beginning with 1 are INPUT status codes, meaning:

The requested resource accepts a line of textual user input.  The <META>
line is a prompt which should be displayed to the user.  The same
resource should then be requested again with the user's input included
as a query component.  Queries are included in requests as per the usual
generic URL definition in RFC3986, i.e. separated from the path by a ?.
Reserved characters used in the user's input must be "percent-encoded"
as per RFC3986, and space characters should also be percent-encoded.
```

=> 3.2.1.percent ▶️ Enter the following (keep spaces): 99 + 1%
=> 3.2.1.long ▶️ Copy and enter the following (1300 characters). Client should not send request and show error to the user.

```
