## Spec excerpt

Servers MUST use TLS version 1.2 or higher and SHOULD use TLS version 1.3 or higher.  TLS 1.2 is reluctantly permitted for now to avoid drastically reducing the range of available implementation libraries.  Hopefully TLS 1.3 or higher can be specced in the near future.  Clients who wish to be "ahead of the curve MAY refuse to connect to servers using TLS version 1.2 or lower.
