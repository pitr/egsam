## Spec excerpt

Status codes beginning with 1 are INPUT status codes, meaning:

The requested resource accepts a line of textual user input.  The <META> line is a prompt which should be displayed to the user.  The same resource should then be requested again with the user's input included as a query component.  Queries are included in requests as per the usual generic URL definition in RFC3986, i.e. separated from the path by a ?.  Reserved characters used in the user's input must be "percent-encoded" as per RFC3986, and space characters should also be percent-encoded.
